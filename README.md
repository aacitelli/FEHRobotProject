# Robot Project

This is the codebase for a 3-month-long project completed as part of ENGR 1281.02H, an project class in Ohio State's College of Engineering Honors Program.

The gist of the project was to conceive, design, build, and program a small, smaller than 12"-12"-12" robot that navigates through a small obstacle 
course and completes a multitude of tasks. Each team was made of 3-4 people, and each team was responsible for extensive documentation, programming, and reports.
